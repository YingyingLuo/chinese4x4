## 4x4 Chinese Learning Technique

A family friend developed the 4x4 technique on paper a few years ago, and the technique has proven to be fast and efficient for learning. But as far as we know, a digital version has not been made before. Our implementation on the web saves paper and helps the environment.

The 4x4 technique has proven extremely practical for children living outside of China who already have the understanding ability in another language to learn Chinese. As a short-term example, using the 4x4 technique, an 8-year-old child learned a set of 16 characters (4 idioms) in less than 8 minutes. As a long-term example, one of our team members used the 4x4 technique daily and learned over 2000 characters in a matter of months. For reference, the 500 highest-frequency Chinese characters account for 75% of the language used on a daily basis, and the 1000 highest-frequency characters account for 90%.
